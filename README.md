# Diffused

Currently WIP - the aim here is to build out a series of interesting protocols to see where the evolution takes it.

**Infrastructure:**

 - `Mediatr.Actor` - an actor framework extension for Mediatr. This utilises TPL Dataflow ActionBlock<T> in a scoped registration, intercepting it to the request and defers it to the queue. 

**Gossip:**

 - Swim (WIP) 
 - Croupier (Next)

**Consensus:**

 - Raft (Next)
